# walnut_cognition_analysis-python

# Simple Data Analysis Example for Neuroscience Application

## Overview
This Python script simulates and analyzes cognitive score data related to walnut intake in three groups: Control, Low Walnut, and High Walnut. It demonstrates basic data creation, summary statistics, visualization, and exporting results.

## Features
- Generates synthetic cognitive score data for 3 groups (30 samples each).
- Calculates and prints descriptive statistics for each group.
- Creates a boxplot to visualize cognitive scores across groups.
- Saves the plot as an image file (`cognitive_scores.png`).
- Exports the simulated data to a CSV file (`cognitive_scores.csv`).

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them via pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
